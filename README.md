#GoCD Test Project

A Java project used as an example project moving through a GoCD pipeline. It uses Maven for testing, building, packaging, and deploying to an artifact server. Dynamic version bumping will happen upon successful testing and building, the result of which will be a tag on the Github repo and an appropriately named package for uploading.
